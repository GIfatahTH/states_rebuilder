# 3.0.0 change details

* Add global functional injection feature. [Here](https://github.com/GIfatahTH/states_rebuilder/issues/123)

* Add undo / redo state feature. [Here](https://github.com/GIfatahTH/states_rebuilder/issues/121)

* Add `shouldRebuild` parameter to `StateBuilder` and other widgets.
    Now `StateBuilder` will build only if the exposed model hasData (For performance reason).
    This may cause some unexpected behavior.
    For the widget to rebuild on other state (onWaiting, onError), you can:
    - Use `WhenRebuilderOr` widget. Or,
    - return true in `shouldRebuild` parameter
    ```dart
    StateBuilder(
      observe: ()=>MyReactiveModel(),
      shouldRebuild: (rm)=> true,
      builder: (context, rm){
        //--
      }
    )
  ```

* The API of `StateWithMixinBuilder` has changed and named constructors have been added.
