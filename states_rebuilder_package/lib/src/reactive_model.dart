///An abstract class that defines the reactive environment.
///
///`states_rebuilder` is based on the concept of [ReactiveModel].
///
///Pure dart models (or Blocs, or Stores) can be injected globally using the [Injector].
///To obtained the injected ReactiveModel singleton, you use :
///```dart
/// final modelRM = Injector.getAsReactive<T>();
/// //or more concisely:
/// final modelRM = ReactiveModel<T>();
/// // or even more concisely (since 1.15.0 release):
/// final modelRM = RM.get<T>();
///```
///
///In another hand, [ReactiveModel] can can be created locally.
///```dart
/////creating a reactive model form integer
///final counterRM = ReactiveModel<int>.create(0);
///// or more concisely (since 1.15.0 release)
///final counterRM = RM.create<int>(0);
///```
///
///with `states_rebuilder` we can locally create `ReactiveModel` from primitive values, objects, futures or streams.
///
///To consume the created `ReactiveModel`, we use one of the available widget observers : [StateBuilder], [WhenRebuilder], [WhenRebuilderOr] or [OnSetStateListener].
///
///
///[ReactiveModel] adds the following getters and methods:
///
///* To trigger an event : [setState], [setValue]
///
///* To get the current state : [state],[value]
///
///* For streams and futures: [subscription],  [snapshot].
///
///* Far asynchronous tasks :[connectionState], [hasError], [error], [hasData].
///
///and many more...
