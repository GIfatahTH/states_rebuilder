///A Wrapper class that encloses the state of the model we want to Inject. The
///state can be mutable or immutable.
///
///Injected model can be instantiated globally or as a member of classes. They
///can be instantiated inside the build method without losing the state after
///rebuilds.
///
///
///* **Injected instantiation:**
///To instantiate an Injected model, you use [RM.inject], [RM.injectFuture],
///[RM.injectStream] or [RM.injectFlavor].
///
///
///* **Injected lifecycle:**
///The state wrapped by the Injected model has a lifecycle. It is created when
///first used and destroyed when no longer used even if it is declared globally.
///Between the creation and the destruction of the state, it can be listened to
///and mutated to notify its registered listeners.
///
///
///* **Injected state and null safety:**
///The state of an injected model is null safe, that is it can not be null. For
///this reason the initial state will be inferred by the library, and in case
///it is not, it must be defined explicitly. The initial state of primitives is
///inferred as follows: (int: 0, double, 0.0, String:'', and bool: false). For
///other non-primitive objects the initial state will be the first created
///instance.
///
///
///* **Listening to an Injected:**
///To listen to an Injected model you can use one of the following options:
///[ReactiveModelBuilder.listen], [ReactiveModelBuilder.futureBuilder],
///[ReactiveModelBuilder.streamBuilder], [ReactiveModelBuilder.rebuilder],
///[ReactiveModelBuilder.whenRebuilder], and
///[ReactiveModelBuilder.whenRebuilderOr].
///
///
///* **Injected state mutation:**
///To mutate the state and notify listeners, you use [ReactiveModel.state]
///setter, [ReactiveModel.setState], or[ ReactiveModel.toggle] if the state is
///bool.
///You can also notify listeners without changing the state using
///[ReactiveModel.notify]. You can also refresh the state to its initial state
///and reinvoke the creation function then notify listeners using
///[ReactiveModel.refresh].
///
///
///* **Injected state cleaning:**
///When the state is disposed of, its list of listeners is cleared, and if the
///state is waiting for a Future or subscribed to a Stream, it will cancel them
///to free resources.
///
///
///* **State persistence:**
///Injected state can be persisted using [PersistState]. By default the state
///is persisted each time the state is mutated. You can set it to persist
///manually or when the state is disposed. You can also throttle state
///persistence for the time you want.
///
///
///* **Undo redo state mutation:**
///You can undo or redo state mutation by defining the `undoStackLength`
///parameter of [RM.inject] [RM.injectFuture], [RM.injectStream] or
///[RM.injectFlavor]. After state mutation you can redo it using
///[ReactiveModelUndoRedoState.undoState] and redo it using
///[ReactiveModelUndoRedoState.redoState].
///
///
///* **Injected model dependence**
///Injected models can depend on other Injected models and recalculate its
///state and notify its listeners whenever any of its of the Inject model that
///it depends on emits a notification.
///
///
///* **Injected mock for testing:**
///Injected model can be easily mocked to fake implementation in tests using :
///[Injected.injectMock], [Injected.injectFutureMock],
///or [Injected.injectStreamMock].
///
///

  ///By default the [InheritedWidget] holds the state of the injected model,

  ///Child widgets can obtain the wrapped state using `.of(context)` or

  ///* `myModel.of(context)` looks up in the widget tree to find the state of

  ///* `myModel.call(context) or myModel(context)` looks up in the widget tree
  ///to find the injected model `myModel` without registering the `BuildContext`.
