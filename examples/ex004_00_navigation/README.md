# ex004_00_navigation

## Getting Started
First, make sure you have installed states_rebuilder package, please check out the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/GIfatahTH/states_rebuilder/tree/master/states_rebuilder_package#getting-started-with-states_rebuilder). 
<Br />

Second, if you are from Old Navigation 1.0, please take a took at [Introduction to `RM.injectNavigator` and Migration Guide from Nav1](https://github.com/GIfatahTH/states_rebuilder/issues/249).


## Objective

In this example, you will learn how to work on Flutter Navigation 2.0 (Nav2) more easily with states_rebuilder's API `RM.injectNavigator`.


Basic in use: [Quick demo of below code](https://github.com/GIfatahTH/states_rebuilder/blob/dev/examples/ex004_00_navigation/lib/ex14_return_data_from_screen.dart)

```Dart
final navigator = RM.injectNavigator(
  routes: {
    '/': (data) => const HomeScreen(),
    '/selection-screen': (data) => const SelectionScreen(),
  },
);
```

## Exploring Use-cases

  <br /><b> Description: </b>
  The same as pervious example 04 & 05, it is using `RouteWidget` with static helper methods to decentralize the route logic from one place to belonging page widget.
