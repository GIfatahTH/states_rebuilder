This is a TodoMVC clone using states_rebuilder following the flutter_bloc approach.

For the sake of science, and comparing with the leaders in the field of Flutter state management, I followed  the same implementation as in [Flutter sample Architecture repository](https://github.com/brianegan/flutter_architecture_samples/tree/master/bloc_library)

To run the app in the chrome web browser :

> flutter run -t lib/main_web.dart -d chrome
