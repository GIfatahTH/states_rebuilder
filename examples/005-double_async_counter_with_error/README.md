This is a counter application that has two counter that shares the same model. The first counter increments a counter after waiting for 1 second and has a 1/2 probability of generating an error. Whereas the second counter does the same thing but after waiting for 3 seconds.

If an error is thrown, an alert snackBar will appear giving information about the error.

This example has three pages:

* Page one: The tow counters will share the same reactive environment. We will see how counters interfere with each other. I call this polluted environment.

* Page two: This will show how to make the environment clean using tags.
* Page three: It will show how to make the reactive environment cleaner by creating a new reactive environment for each counter.

# Model

*file : counter.dart*

```dart
class Counter {
  Counter(this.count);
  int count;

  void increment() {
    count++;
  }
}
```
# Error
To handle error it is very convenient to use your custom error classes.

*file : counter_error.dart*

```dart
class CounterError extends Error {
  final String message = 'A permission issue, please contact your administrator';
}
```



# Service
The role of the `CounterService` class is to instantiate the counter (usually via the repository) and define the use cases to be used by the user interface.


```dart
import 'dart:math';

import 'counter.dart';
import 'counter_error.dart';

class CounterService {
  CounterService() {
    counter = Counter(0);
  }
  Counter counter;

  Future<void> increment(int seconds) async {
    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: seconds));

    if (Random().nextBool()) {
      throw CounterError();
    } else {
      counter.increment();
    }
  }
}
```
`increment` method takes the second of the waiting as parameter.

>This is all the business logic of your app. It is testable, maintainable and framework independent. 

# User Interface

## Shared reactive environment (polluted environment):

*file : counter_page.dart*

The first thing is to inject `CounterService` in the widget tree at the level where we want it to be available. 
For this simple example, we can inject it at the `home` parameter of the `MaterialApp` widget.
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:states_rebuilder/states_rebuilder.dart';

import 'counter_service.dart';

class App extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Future counter with error')),
      body: Injector(
        inject: [Inject(() => CounterService())],
        builder: (BuildContext context) {

          //NOTE1 : Getting the countersService registered reactive environment using the context.
          final ReactiveModel<CounterService> counterService =
              RM.get(context: context);

          return Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              //NOTE2: CounterPage widget for one second of waiting
              CounterPage(
                counterService: counterService,
                seconds: 1,
              ),
              //NOTE2 : CounterPage widget for three seconds of waiting
              CounterPage(
                counterService: counterService,
                seconds: 3,
              ),
            ],
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
After injecting the `CounterService` class, we get the registered singleton in the builder callback of the `Injector` widget.
>Injected models are available even within the `Injector` widget where they are injected.

the registered singleton of `CounterService` is obtained using `RM.get` with context because we want this widget to be notified by the 'counterService' object. [NOTE1]

>If you want to get the registered reactive singleton and at the same time subscribe it to the obtained instance, you use `RM.get` with context. If the context is not available, you can get the reactive singleton `RM.get` without context and subscribe it to the model using `StateBuilder` widget.

`CounterPage` widget is written so that to be reusable and parametrized. It is used twice; the first for one second of wait ant the other for three seconds of wait. [NOTE2]

```dart
class CounterPage extends StatelessWidget {
  CounterPage({this.seconds, this.counterService});

  final int seconds;
  final ReactiveModel<CounterService> counterService;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      child: Column(
        children: <Widget>[
          WhenRebuilder(
            observe: () => counterService,
            onIdle: () => Text(
                'Top on the plus button to start incrementing the counter'),
            onWaiting: () => Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: <Widget>[
                CircularProgressIndicator(),
                Text('$seconds second(s) wait'),
              ],
            ),
            onError: (error) => Text(

         IconButton(
            onPressed: () {
              //NOTE2: To call a method that will mutate the state and notify listeners
              counterService.setState(
                (state) => state.increment(seconds),
                //NOTE2 : If increment method throws, it will not break the app.
                catchError: true,
                //NOTE2: Side effect to be executed after sending notification and before rebuilding observers
                onSetState: (BuildContext context) {
                  //NOTE3: context parameter of the onSetState is the context of the last add observer. In our case, it is the BuildContext of the Injector widget.

                    );
                  }
                },

                //    ),
                //  );
                //},
              );
            },
            icon: Icon(
              Icons.add_circle,

`CounterPage` is a simple widget that displays a counter text with plus button to increment it. The display page depends on the reactive singleton `counterService` state. [NOTE1].

To Trigger an event that will mutate the state of the `counterService` and end by notifying subscribed widgets, we used `setState` method.[NOTE2].

`onSetState` callback will be called after sending notification and before rebuilding widgets. If you want to execute the callback after rebuilding listening widgets, use `onRebuildState`.

The BuildContext passed to the `onSetState` callback is of the BuildContext of the last added observer.

>states_rebuilder uses the observer pattern, to add observers to observable object, you either:
> * use of the `RM.get` method with the context parameter provided.
> * use `StateBuilder` widget.

> `onSetState` and `onRebuildState` can be called in `setState` method for one time use after calling `setState`, or in `StateBuilder` for each time a notification is sent form  models observed by the `StateBuilder` widget.

Try it and you can see that if one counter is incremented, it will affect the other counter because the two counters share the same reactive environment.

## Shared reactive environment (cleaning environment with tags):

With states_rebuilder any time you want to have more control over when to send notification and which widgets will be notified to rebuild, you think directly to `StateBuilder` widget.

`StateBuilder` has a parameter called `tag`, which is used to mark it with a reference so that notification can be filtered by tags.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:states_rebuilder/states_rebuilder.dart';

import 'counter_service.dart';

class App extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Future counter with error')),
      body: Injector(
        inject: [Inject(() => CounterService())],
        builder: (BuildContext context) {
          //NOTE1: Getting the registered reactive singleton without the context
          final ReactiveModel<CounterService> counterService =
              RM.get();

          return Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              CounterPage(
                counterService: counterService,
                seconds: 1,
                //NOTE2: add the tag parameter
                tag: 'counter1',
              ),
              CounterPage(
                counterService: counterService,
                seconds: 3,
                //NOTE2: add the tag parameter
                tag: 'counter2',
              ),
            ],
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
The registered reactive singleton is obtained using `RM.get` without the context.[NOTE1]

>Whenever you use `StateBuilder` remove the context from `RM.get` because `StateBuilder` subscribe to the model and is better for fine-tune rebuild.

A `tag` is added to the `CounterPage` widget.

```dart
class CounterPage extends StatelessWidget {
  CounterPage({this.seconds, this.counterService, this.tag});
  final int seconds;
  final ReactiveModel<CounterService> counterService;
  //added tag field
  final String tag;
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      child: Column(
        children: <Widget>[

          WhenRebuilder(
            //NOTE1: subscription to the counterService model
            observe: () => counterService,
            //NOTE1: defining filtrating tag to this StateBuilder widget
            tag: tag,
            onIdle: () => Text(
                'Top on the plus button to start incrementing the counter'),
            onWaiting: () => Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: <Widget>[
                CircularProgressIndicator(),
                Text('$seconds second(s) wait'),
              ],
            ),
            onError: (error) => Text(
              counterService.error.message,
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.red),
            ),
            onData: (data) => Text(
              ' ${counterService.state.counter.count}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30),
            ),
          ),
          IconButton(
            onPressed: () {
              counterService.setState(
                (state) => state.increment(seconds),
                //NOTE3: Defining list of tags to be notified.
                filterTags: [tag],
                onError: (BuildContext context, dynamic error) {
                  Scaffold.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(
                      content: Text(counterService.error.message),
                    ),
                  );
                },
              );
            },
            icon: Icon(
              Icons.add_circle,
              color: Theme.of(context).primaryColor,
            ),
            iconSize: 40,
          ),
        ],
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
      ),
      // Decoration of the Container
      height: 100,
      alignment: Alignment.center,
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        border: Border.all(
          width: 2,
          color: Theme.of(context).primaryColor,
        ),
      ),
      margin: EdgeInsets.all(1),
    );
  }
}
```
`StateBuilder` is used instead of `Builder` widget as in the previous example. [NOTE1].

Now `SetState` method is called with `filterTags` parameter defined. It takes a list of tags to be used to filter the notification.

With this little change, counters look like to function independently.

## New reactive environment:

states_rebuilder caches two singletons for each registered model.
* Raw singleton of the model.
* reactive singleton of the model which is the raw singleton decorated with the reactive environment.

> `Injector.get<T>()` returns the raw singleton of type `T` of the registered model.    
> `RM.get<T>()` returns the reactive singleton of type `ReactiveModel<T>` of the registered model.  

With `states_rebuilder`, you can create, at any time, a new reactive instance, which is the same raw cashed singleton but decorated with a new reactive environment.

One way to create a new reactive instance of an injected model is to use `RM.get` appended with `asNew('seed')`;

```dart
final reactiveModel = RM.get<Model>();
final newReactiveModel = reactiveModel.asNew('mySeed');

// or directly

final newReactiveModel = RM.get<Model>().asNew('mySeed');
```
By setting the seed parameter of the `asNew` method your are sure to get the same new reactive instance even after the widget rebuilds.

The seed parameter is optional, and if not provided, `states_rebuilder` uses a default seed.

>seed here has a similar meaning in random number generator. That is for the same seed we get the same new reactive instance.

For our case : 

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:states_rebuilder/states_rebuilder.dart';

import 'counter_service.dart';

class App extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Future counter with error')),
      body: Injector(
        inject: [Inject(() => CounterService())],
        builder: (BuildContext context) {
          //NOTE1: get the singleton reactive model
          final counterService = RM.get<CounterService>();

          return Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              CounterPage(
                //NOTE1: pass the new reactive instance with seed value of counterService1
                counterService: counterService.asNew('counterService1'),
                seconds: 1,
                //tag parameter is removed
              ),
              CounterPage(
                //NOTE1: pass the new reactive instance with seed value of counterService2
                counterService: counterService.asNew('counterService2'),
                seconds: 3,
              ),
            ],
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
>New reactive instances are not registered with in the service locator.

Another way to get a new reactive instance is to use `StateBuilder` with generic type and without 'models' property.
```dart
StateBuilder<T>(
  builder:(BuildContext context, T newReactiveModel){
    return YourWidget();
  }
)
```

In our case:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:states_rebuilder/states_rebuilder.dart';

import 'counter_service.dart';

class App extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text('Future counter with error')),
      body: Injector(
        inject: [Inject(() => CounterService())],
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
          return Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: <Widget>[
              //NOTE1: Using StateBuilder with generic type and without models parameter
              StateBuilder<CounterService>(
                builder: (BuildContext context,
                    ReactiveModel<CounterService> counterService) {
                  return CounterPage(
                    //The second parameter of the builder callback is the created new reactive instance
                    counterService: counterService,
                    seconds: 1,
                  );
                },
              ),
              StateBuilder<CounterService>(
                builder: (BuildContext context, counterService) {
                  return CounterPage(
                    counterService: counterService,
                    seconds: 3,
                  );
                },
              ),
            ],
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

> except for the raw singleton they share, the reactive singleton and the new reactive instances have an independent reactive environment. That is when a particular reactive instance issues a notification with an error or in a waiting state, it will not affect other reactive environments. Nevertheless `states_rebuilder` allows reactive instances to share their notification or state with the reactive singleton. (Object of new example).

The `CounterPage` widget is : 

```dart

class CounterPage extends StatelessWidget {
  CounterPage({this.seconds, this.counterService});
  final int seconds;
  final ReactiveModel<CounterService> counterService;
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      child: Column(
        children: <Widget>[
        //Use of `WhenRebuilder` without a tag.
          WhenRebuilder(
            observe: () => counterService,
            onIdle: () => Text(
                'Top on the plus button to start incrementing the counter'),
            onWaiting: () => Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: <Widget>[
                CircularProgressIndicator(),
                Text('$seconds second(s) wait'),
              ],
            ),
            onError: (error) => Text(
              counterService.error.message,
              style: TextStyle(color: Colors.red),
            ),
            onData: (data) => Text(
              ' ${counterService.state.counter.count}',
              style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30),

                onError: (BuildContext context, dynamic error) {
