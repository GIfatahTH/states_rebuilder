In this example, we will build a countdown timer.

![countDown timer](https://github.com/GIfatahTH/repo_images/blob/master/006-countdown_timer.gif).

The countdown timer has three status:
1. ready status: The initial time is displayed with a play button. 
2. running status: The time is ticking down each second with two buttons to pause and replay the timer.
3. paused status: The timer is paused with two buttons to resume and stop the timer
