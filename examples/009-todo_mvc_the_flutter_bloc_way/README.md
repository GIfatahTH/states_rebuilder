# todo_mvc_the_flutter_bloc_way

This is a TodoMVC clone using states_rebuilder following the flutter_bloc approach.

For the sake of science, and comparing with the leaders in the field of Flutter state management, I followed  the same implementation as in [Flutter sample Architecture repository](https://github.com/brianegan/flutter_architecture_samples/tree/master/bloc_library)
