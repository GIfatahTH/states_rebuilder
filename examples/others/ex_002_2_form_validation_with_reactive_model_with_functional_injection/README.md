In this tutorial we will explore more feature of the `ReactiveModel` and put into practice what we have seen in the first tutorial.

Let's build a simple login form validation. It consists of two input fields and a submit button. 
* Email input field : is valid if it contains '@'.
* Password input field : is valid if it contains more than three characters.
* Submit button : is inactive unless both email and password are valid.
